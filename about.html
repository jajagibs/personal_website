        <h4>Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Janella Gibaga, and I am an aspiring web developer currently entering my third year of college. I have a strong passion for creating dynamic and visually appealing websites that combine both functionality and aesthetics.
          <br><br>
          Ever since I was introduced to the world of web development, I have been captivated by its limitless possibilities and the ability to bring ideas to life on the internet. I am constantly seeking to enhance my skills and stay up to date with the latest trends and technologies in the field.
          <br><br>
          During my time in college, I have been fortunate enough to gain a solid foundation in web development through my coursework and various personal projects. I have experience with front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
          <br><br>
          In addition to my technical skills, I possess strong problem-solving abilities and a keen eye for detail. I believe that effective web development requires not only technical expertise but also a deep understanding of user experience and the ability to create intuitive and user-friendly interfaces.
          <br><br>
          Beyond my technical skills, I am a dedicated and hardworking individual who values continuous learning and self-improvement. I am a quick learner and adaptable, always open to exploring new technologies and approaches that can enhance my web development repertoire.
          <br><br>
          As I progress through my college education, I am eager to expand my knowledge and expertise in web development further. I am actively seeking opportunities to work on real-world projects and gain hands-on experience to refine my skills and contribute to the field.
          <br><br>
          Thank you for visiting my portfolio website. Feel free to explore my projects and contact me if you would like to collaborate or have any inquiries. I look forward to connecting with you and discussing how we can bring your web development ideas to life!
